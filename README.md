# Rory Watts
Hi there, my name is Rory Watts.
This is my GitHub page. My activity looks quiet but most of my work is in private repos currently.
I have a PhD in Public Health, a Master of Public Health, a Bachelor of Arts, and a Bachelor of Medical Science.
I am the founder of [Forecast Health Australia](www.forecasthealth.org), an organisation which helps groups make decisions about health policy and health resources.
I consult with the World Health Organization, providing expertise in health economics and tool-building.
In my spare time, I play guitar, sing, and teach.
[Here's my (very minimal) website](https://rorywatts.github.io)
If you'd like to contact me, please email rory.watts@gmail.com
